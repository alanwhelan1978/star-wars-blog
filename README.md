## Features

### Existing Features

-   __F01 Navigation Bar__
    
    The navigation bar has a consistent look and placement each page supporting easy and intuitive navigation.  It includes a link to the Home page (Blog). If the user is not signed in then links are available to the Register and Sign in pages.  If a user is signed in then the links available, in addition to the Home link (landing page), are for Blog and Sign out.
    
    The navigation bar is responsive on multiple screen sizes - on smaller screens it coverts to a 'burger' menu style.

-   __F02 Landing page image and text__
    
    At the top of the landing page (home page) there is an area that includes text which clearly identify the purpose of the site.  

    ![Landing Area]()

-   __F03 Blog Information__

    
    When a user clicks on a blog summary title on the blog page they are brought to a new page with full details of the blog post.  Here the user is shown a full details of the post, information on when the post was created, comments and likes on the post. Only users who are signed in can comment on a post or 'like' a post.  Commenting on a post is detailed below in F05 Comment on a post.  Liking a post is detailed below in F06 Like a post.

 
-   __F05 Comment on hike__
    
    In order to comment on a post a user must be signed in.  A comment can be added on any post page.  The user enters their comment in a text box under the hike description and clicks on Submit.  The comment must be approved by the admin user before it will be visible on the post page.  
    
    To approve comments the admin user logs in to the admin pages, opens the Comments table, selects the comment(s) to be approved, chooses the 'Approve Comments' action from the drop-down menu and clicks 'Go'.  Alternatively, they can be approved one at a time by clicking on the comment row to open it, updating the value in the approved field and saving the update.
    
    All comments approved for a post are shown on that post's Post Detail page in the order of newest first.

    ![Hike Comment]()

    ![Approve Hike Comment]()

-   __F06 Like a hike__
    In order to like a post a user must be signed in.  A post can be liked on its Post Detail page. The user simply needs to click on the like/heart icon to toggle between like/unlike.

    ![Like Hike]()

-   __F07 User authentication__
    
    The application provides the following user authentication related functions :

    - User Registration
      - A user needs to be registered before they can sign in.  The option to Register appears on the navigation bar when no user is currently signed in.  To Register, the user needs to provide a) a username which has not already been registered, b) an optional email address (if this is provided then it needs to be an email address that is not already registered) and c) a password which they must enter twice.  Once registered a user can sign in.

        ![Register User]()

    - User Sign in
      - Once registered a user can sign in and will have access to extra functionality, namely :
        - can comment on a post
        - can like a post
 

      - To sign in the user must provide a) a registered username and b) the password for the username
     
        ![Sign in User]()
      
    - User Sign out
      - A signed in user can sign out by clicking on the Sign out link on the navigation bar.  The user simply needs to confirm the action by clicking on the Sign out button on the page.

        ![Sign out User](documentation/supp-images/f12-signout-user.png)

-   __F11 Add and Publish a Post__
    
    The admin user adds and publishes hikes using the admin pages.  The admin user can access these pages either by appending '/admin' to the application url or by signing in to the application and clicking on the Admin link that appears on the navigation bar only when admin is signed in.

    To add a new post, the admin user can use the "+ Add" link to the right of the post table name and then fill in the data fields for the hike.  Post titles must be unique and a slug will be automatically generated as the title is typed in.   A rich editor (summernote) is made available for the hike description content field so that formatting can be easily added. A default image will be used for the hike if the admin user does not upload one.  Post can be saved with a status of Draft (default) and will not be visible to general users until this status is updated to Published - this allows the admin to save a hike a WIP and finish it later.

    ![Add a Post]()

-   __F12 On-screen messages__
    
    To enhance usability of the application, user messages appear on-screen to confirm when certain actions have happened or report on problems.  For successful operations, a message will appear at the top of the screen and then fade-out/slide-up after a few seconds.  For problems logging in, messages will appear in red text on-screen and stay until a user attempts the operation again.

    ![User Story Feature Matrix]()

## Design


## Planning

A GitHub Project with linked Issues was used as the Agile tool for this project.  User Stories with acceptance criteria were defined using GitHub Issues and development of code for these stories was managed using a Kanban board.  All of the User Stories were linked to a 'parent' Epic issue to show how they all supported the over-arching goal of the project.  The acceptance criteria were tested as each story moved to 'Done' and were also included in the final pre-submission manual testing documented in the Testing section of this README.

The Epic, User Stories and Kanban board can be accessed here : [Wayfarers Agile Tool](https://github.com/elainebroche-dev/pf4-wayfarers-guided-hikes/projects/1)

## Testing

### Validator Testing 

- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

    - As this project uses Django templates the html has been validated by manually clicking through the application pages, copying the source of the rendered pages and then validating this version of the html using the W3C Validator (link shown above).  HTML  for the Django admin site pages was not edited so has not been validated here.  The Signup, Login and Logout pages from Django allauth were customized and so have been validated, with results below

## Deployment

Detailed below are instructions on how to clone this project repository and the steps to configure and deploy the application.  Code Institute also provides a summary of similar process steps here : [CI Cheat Sheet](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fst/Django%20Blog%20Cheat%20Sheet%20v1.pdf)

1. How to Clone the Repository
2. Create Application and Postgres DB on Heroku
3. Configure Cloudinary to host images used by the application
4. Connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository
5. Executing automated tests
6. Final Deployment steps

### How to Clone the Repository 

- Go to the https://github.com/elainebroche-dev/pf4-wayfarers-guided-hikes repository on GitHub 
- Click the "Code" button to the right of the screen, click HTTPs and copy the link there
- Open a GitBash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to locate the clone
- On the command line, type "git clone" then paste in the copied url and press the Enter key to begin the clone process
- To install the packages required by the application use the command : pip install -r requirements.txt
- When developing and running the application locally set DEBUG=True in the settings.py file
- Changes made to the local clone can be pushed back to the repository using the following commands :

  - git add *filenames*  (or "." to add all changed files)
  - git commit -m *"text message describing changes"*
  - git push

- N.B. Any changes pushed to the master branch will take effect on the live project once the application is re-deployed from Heroku

### Create Application and Postgres DB on Heroku
- Log in to Heroku at https://heroku.com - create an account if needed.
- From the Heroku dashboard, click the Create new app button.  For a new account an icon will be visible on screen to allow you to Create an app, otherwise a link to this function is located under the New dropdown menu at the top right of the screen.
- On the Create New App page, enter a unique name for the application and select region.  Then click Create app.
- On the Application Configuration page for the new app, click on the Resources tab.
- In the Add-ons search bar enter "Postgres" and select "Heroku Postgres" from the list - click the "Submit Order Form" button on the pop-up dialog.
- Next, click on Settings on the Application Configuration page and click on the "Reveal Config Vars" button - check the DATABASE_URL has been automatically set up. 
- Add a new Config Var called DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and assign it a value of 1.
- Add a new Config Var called SECRET_KEY and assign it a value - any random string of letters, digits and symbols.
- The settings.py file should be updated to use the DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY environment variable values as follows :

  - DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))}

  - SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

- In Gitpod, in the project terminal window, to initialize the data model in the postgres database, run the command : python3 manage.py migrate 
- Make sure the project requirements.txt file is up to date with all necessary supporting files by entering the command : pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
- Commit and push any local changes to GitHub.
- In order to be able to run the application on localhost, add SECRECT_KEY and DATABASE_URL and their values to env.py

### Configure Cloudinary to host images used by the application
- Log in to Cloudinary - create an account if needed.  To create the account provide your name, email and set up a password.  For "primary interest" you can choose "Programmable Media for image and video API".  Click "Create Account" and you will be sent an email to verify your account and bring you to the dashboard.
- From the dashboard, copy the "API Environment variable" value by clicking on the "Copy to clipboard" link.
- Log in to Heroku and go to the Application Configuration page for the application.  Click on Settings and click on the "Reveal Config Vars" button.
- Add a new Config Var called CLOUDINARY_URL and assign it the value copied from the Cloudinary dashboard, but remove the "CLOUDINARY_URL=" at the beginning of the string. 
- In order to be able to run the application on localhost, also add the CLOUDINARY_URL environment variable and value to env.py

### Connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository
- Go to the Application Configuration page for the application on Heroku and click on the Deploy tab.
- Select GitHub as the Deployment Method and if prompted, confirm that you want to connect to GitHub. Enter the name of the github repository (the one used for this project is () and click on Connect to link up the Heroku app to the GitHub repository code.
- Scroll down the page and choose to either Automatically Deploy each time changes are pushed to GitHub, or Manually deploy - for this project Manual Deploy was selected.
- The application can be run from the Application Configuration page by clicking on the Open App button.
- The live link for this project is ()

### Executing automated tests
- The existing automated jquery/javascript test can be executed using jest as follows :
  - If jest is not installed then run the command : npm install --save-dev jest
  - Run the js test file using the command : npm test

- The existing automated django/python tests are executed using unittest as follows :
  - Run the python tests using the command : python3 manage.py test
  - To run just a subset of the tests, then append the application and test file name to the command, e.g. : python3 manage.py test hikebooker.test_models

- Test coverage for the django/python tests can be reviewed using the coverage tool :
  - If coverage is not installed then run the command : pip3 install coverage
  - Execute the following series of commands to determine test coverage :
    - coverage run --source=hikebooker manage.py test
    - coverage report
    - coverage html
    - python3 -m http.server  (detailed results can be viewed via the browser in the htmlcov directory)


### Final Deployment steps
Once code changes have been completed and tested on localhost, the application can be prepared for Heroku deployment as follows :
- Set DEBUG flag to False in settings.py
- Ensure this line exists in settings.py to make summernote work on the deployed environment (CORS security feature): X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'SAMEORIGIN'
- Ensure requirements.txt is up to date using the command : pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
- Push files to GitHub
- In the Heroku Config Vars for the application delete this environment variable :  DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
- On the Heroku dashboard go to the Deploy tab for the application and click on deploy branch
