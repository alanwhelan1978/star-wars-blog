                            <p>The R2-D2 we all know and love speaks only in beeps and whistles, a robot language that most of his friends can understand. But in the original draft of Star Wars, written in 1974, R2-D2 spoke in complete sentences.

                                Even more alarming, he was not the lovable goof he would later become. He was actually kind of a bully, berating his pal C-3PO with insults like, "You're a mindless, useless philosopher," and "You're nothing more than a dim-witted, emotion-brained intellectual. Why you were created is beyond my logic systems." Sheesh, take the hostility down a notch, will ya?</p>

                            <p>Long before Yoda was created with animatronics and puppetry, by master Muppeteer Frank Oz, the plan was to hire an actual actor… a simian actor, that is. According to The Making of Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back, they planned to dress up a real monkey in a Yoda costume and mask. There are photos of the monkey in training and the weirdly hideous Yoda mask prototype.
                                Luckily, a crew member who'd previously worked on 2001: A Space Odyssey pointed out that the apes used in that movie's opening were a huge headache, which was enough to convince Empire's filmmakers to fire their Yoda monkey.</p>

                            <p>When we think of Darth Vader, the first name that comes to mind is James Earl Jones, the voice behind the series' most infamous villain. But the man in the costume was somebody entirely different, a British bodybuilder named David Prowse. And Prowse apparently isn't among Lucas's favorite people.
                                As Prowse revealed on his website (which has since been taken down), he has been banned from all "Lucasfilm associated events," which includes conventions and other Star Wars celebrations. When he reached out for an explanation, Prowse said he was told "that I have 'burnt too many bridges between Lucasfilm and myself'—no other reason given." Lucas declined to elaborate, but rumors abound about the rift, with many believing that Prowse was a bit too vocal about his displeasure in learning that another actor, Sebastian Shaw, would be used for the Vader unmasking scene</p>
